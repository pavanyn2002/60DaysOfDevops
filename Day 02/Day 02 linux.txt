Boot process in Linux
Bios post(test) - checks hardware attachments
boot loader  - provides user with multiple boot options
kernel initialization - loads kernel into memory and decompress
init process(systemd) - sets  up init space and operations for user. systemd is responsible for bringing the Linux host to a usable state meanining mounting file systems, starting and managing system services.

ls -l /sbin/init shows if sys5 or systemd is used

2 methods of initiating boot process
reboot
resume halted state


how to set to jump into gui or command mode after boot?
there is someting called runlevel to do it

runlevel command gives a value that implies the function 
3 - cli
5 - gui

systemctl get-default gives the runlevel that is used
systemctl set-default is used to change between multiuser(cli)or graphical(gui) target


file types in linux
every object in linux is considered as file
three types
regular - images, scripts, config
directory - they store other files
special files - characterfiles(allows os to communicate with io devices), block files(hard disks and ram), links(hardlinks and soft links(shortcut)), sockets, namedpipes(from first process to next process)

how to identify file type 
use file command followed by the file to get the type of the file
lshw is used to list hardware


Filesystem hierarchy
/home - home directory except for root directory
/opt -  to install custom projects or applications on linux
/mnt - mounts file system temporarily(from external sources)
/tmp - used to store temporary data
/media - external media is mounted in this directory(df -hp) shows details of these files
/dev - contains special files that were seen in filetypes
/bin - contains the binaries and basic programs
/etc - contains the configuration files lin linux
/lib - shared libraries to be imported to programs
/usr - locations for application data  for user level 
/var - logs and cache data


Package management 
based on Debian and rhel, package managers differ
package is an archive compress that contains all the binaries and metadata required by a software to run
it ensures the signatures of the source of package and manages the dependencies so that we dont get dependency erros while installing a software  

Debian based - dpkg, apt, apt-get
rpm based - rpm, rum, dnf

RPM 
.rpm is the file extension 
install - rpm -ivh package name for detailed installation. i for install, v for detailed realtime process, h for progress bar appearance in hashmark ,
uninstall - rpm -e package name,
upgrade - rpm -Uvh package name. U for upgrade ,
query rpm -q package name ,
verifying - rpm -Vf path to file. used to verify trusted source installation of package.

YUM
it is a higher level package manager.
/etc/yum.repos tell yum where to find the rpm packages 
It depends on rpm 
It handles automatich dependency resolution
we can add custom repos for installing packages of third party applcations
yum first check if dependent packages are already installed in system and also checks the repos file for the for availability of package
asks for y or n to install or not showing the summary


YUM commands
yum repolist - shows all the repos configured
yum provides - Finds which package provides a specific file or feature
yum remove - remove the package
yum update packagename- update a single package
yum update - updates all the packages in the system


Dpkg
.deb is the extension of the file 
dpkg -i packagename
dpkg -r packagename
dpkg -l for listing and desc
dpkg -s for status
dpkg -p maintainer info

apt 
/etc/apt/sources.list contains repository list from which packages can be installed 
apt update to refresh repos
apt upgrade updates all latest packages 
apt edit-sources to edit repos of the sources
apt install packagename
apt remove 
apt search to look for package 
apt list to list all the packagesfrom configured repos
apt is better than atp-get and user friendly output for all commands
